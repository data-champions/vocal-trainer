I would like to place those 2 buttons (currently in PlaybackControls.tsx) next to the select "seleziona la nota" in SequenceControls.

I would like <select> and the 2 buttons to be inline. The 2 buttons should be stacked on top of each other, up and down. The 2 stacked buttons should occupy about 25% of the width and the select the rest.
The 2 buttons should have only arrow and no text (so to minimise their width).

The buttons should keep their functionality (move a note up or down). When the note is moved up or down the <select> should display the updated note (to give immediate feedback). 

Can you implement that?
